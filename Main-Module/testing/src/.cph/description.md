. s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)

This checks whether the first and last characters of the substring are the same.

For example, if s = "racecar", and you’re looking at the substring s[i..j] = "aceca",
then you’re checking if 'a' == 'a' → ✅ True.

If the first and last characters don’t match, the substring cannot be a palindrome.

2. dp[i + 1][j - 1]

This part refers to a previously computed result in the DP (dynamic programming) table.

dp[i][j] typically means:

Is the substring s[i..j] a palindrome?
(True or False)

dp[i + 1][j - 1] means:

Is the inner substring (one step inward from both ends) a palindrome?
That is, s[i+1..j-1].

So if s[i+1..j-1] is already known to be a palindrome, and s[i] == s[j],
then s[i..j] is also a palindrome.
